# The-Office-SQL

 Basic SQL Code to demonstrate my knowledge:
-CREATE TABLE
-INSERT INTO TABLES VALUES
-SELECT AND FROM CLAUSES
-COUNT | DISTINCT | MAX,MIN,AVG
-WHERE CLAUSE AND | OR | LIKE | % | Null | Not Null | In
-GROUP BY | ORDER BY
-JOINS | INNER | LEFT | RIGHT | FULL| OUTER
-JOINS VS UNION
-HAVING CLAUSE 
-UPDATE VS INSERT INTO | DELETING
-ALIASING
-CTE: COMMON TABLE EXPRESSION | WITH QUERY
-PARTITION BY
-STRING FUNCTIONS + USE CASES
-String Functions: TRIM, LTRIM, RTRIM, Replace, Substring, Upper, Lower
-STORE PROCEDURES
-SUBQUERY
